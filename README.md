To basically make it production-ready, two more things need to be done but not mentioned in the assignment.

1. Authentication for API
   - The authentication can be done using JWT and Spring Security
   - The JWT can be generated using a secret key, which can be stored in a configuration file or environment variable.
   - The JWT can be validated using the secret key.
   - The JWT can be added to the API response, which can be used to authenticate subsequent API requests.

2. DataSource and Database Configuration
